# advent-of-code-2024

Solutions to Advent Of Code 2024. To run the solution of day n, use "make DAY=n". Each solution expects its input to be in a file named input.txt.

Finished on 1/7/2024. This year, I:
 - Created generic implementations of BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algoirthm which take functions to get node neighbors and check for end conditions
 - Finally used Regex for some input parsing
 - Learned Bronâ€“Kerbosch Algorithm to find maximal cliques in a graph (Day 23) and edited it to find the maximal clique of greatest size
 - Used reverse engineering techniques to come up with a solution for Day 17
